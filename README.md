# Jekyll code for AI@UHasselt website

## General setup of the pages

Pages are `index.md` (referred to as "home" in the header), `people.md`, ...

Only markdown files that have `navigation_weight` in the preamble are included in the header. The navigation weight itself determines the order on the page.

People etc should be added in the `_data` YAML files.

Icons are from https://design.google.com/icons
